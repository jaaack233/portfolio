            <h1>How we started</h1>
            <p>
                We've been hearing students complain about having problem talk to classmates extracurricularly over and
                over. Every start of the semester is full of <b>anxiety</b> due to unable to find classmates especially
                in
                the online lecturing circumstance. Although communication platforms like <b>piazza</b> or
                <b>campuswire</b>
                are often utilized by class faculties as official communication tool for the class, students also need
                another place to <b>talk more casually</b>
                instead of posting questions on the forum. There are many choices for such a place, for example
                <b>discord</b>,
                messenger, snapchat, wechat. However, it's quite difficult to find the chat group since students have to
                be
                invited or create one and invite others they know from the class. Me and my friends have been struggling
                for three years and now we want to make some changes.
            </p>
            <h1>Key Problems</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>Students don't have an easy access to communicate with other classmates besides who know in class.
                </li>
                <li>Current platforms like campuswire or piazza cannot fullfill students' need for free talking.</li>
                <li>Other message app are not official and require invitation from others, which might be a problem for
                    students who know nobody in those groups.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>

        <h1>Prior Research:</h1>
        <h2>What do students have?</h2>
        <p>
            The most common apps that college students use to communicate with others can be devided into 2 categories:
            <b>Forums</b> like piazza and campuswire, <b>chatrooms</b> like discord, messenger, etc. Forums are usually
            authorized as official communication platform by professors and chatrooms are established by students and
            spread in small scales. Group chatroom in apps like messenger won't be very large, usually just several
            close friends or group members from the same class. Chanels in discord are more public and some famous one can
            contain many students from the same major.
