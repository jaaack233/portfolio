        <h1>How we started</h1>
        <p>
            
        </p>
        <h1>Problems</h1>
        <p>Students don't have an easy access to communicate with other classmates besides who know in class. Current 
            platforms like campuswire or piazza cannot fullfill students' need for free talking. Other message app are
            not official and require invitation from others, which might be a problem for students who know no body in 
            those groups.
        </p>

        <h1>Storyboards</h1>
        


        <h1>Prior Research</h1>
        <p>
            The most common apps that college students use to communicate with others can be devided into 2 categories:
            <b>Forums</b> like piazza and campuswire, <b>chatrooms</b> like discord, messenger, etc. Forums are usually
            authorized as official communication platform by professors and chatrooms are established by students and
            spread in small scales. Group chatroom in apps like messenger won't be very large, usually just several close
            friends or group members from the same class. Chanels in discord are more public and some famous one can contain
            many students from the same major. Each student has own preference 
        </p>

        <h2>Forest</h2>
        <img src="image/focusco/forest.png" alt="" style="width: 100%;">

        <p>Forest is an app that build around the countdown clock. When users use the app, they are planting a tree. As
            long as the user keep using the app, they will have their own forest with all kinds of trees. </p>
        <h3>Pros.</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Simple but with all necessary functions avaliable like record, achievements, timeline, and options for
                countdown</li>
            <li>Beautiful and uniform UI that fits the theme of the app</li>
            <li>Succesfully shows users their efforts and gives them <span>sense of achievement</span></li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Cons.</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>New users have to register new account if they want to experience some functions like friends, store,
                achievements. <span>Third party login not avaliable</span></li>
            <li>Require users to have some extend of self-control ability. Simply wither the tree may not stop user from
                surfing on internet.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Tomato ToDo</h2>
        <p>Unlike Forest, Tomato ToDo has more functions and become predictably more complicated than forest.
            Unfortunately, Tomato ToDo doesn't have language setting and simplified Chinese is the only language
            avaliable.</p>
        <img src="image/focusco/tomato1.png" alt="" style="width: 100%;">

        <ol style="font-size: 20px;">
            <li>
                In this app, users can set multiple clocks and there are three type of clocks: Normal, Habit, Goal
            </li>
            <li>Users can create group of clocks</li>
            <li>Basic user stats tracktion</li>
            <li>Highly costumizable settings including appearence, clock, ect.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Countdown pages:</h3>
        <img src="image/focusco/tomato2.png" alt="" style="width: 100%;">

        <p>The countdown clock of Tomato ToDo allow users to pause for a period of time (adjustable in settings), keep
            screen on, background music, and quit.
            It has more steps to operate incase user want to quit halfway and require user to reflection on the reason.
            If the deep focusing mode is on, when user leave the screen for too long, there will be a alarm to warn
            user.
            <span>This makes the app stronger on monitoring users.</span>
        </p>
        <h3>Pros.</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Powerful, complete functions</li>
            <li>Highly customizable</li>
            <li>Strong monitoring power</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Cons.</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>UI not uniform, UX for setting is a little bit too complicated</li>
            <li>No attractive system to motivate users</li>
            <li>In general feels a little bit heavy</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Our Ideas</h1>
        <p style="font-size: 30px;">We want the simplicity of Forest, the monitoring power of Tomato ToDo, with the
            function to facilitate and
            motivate group working.</p>
        <h2>Prototype 1</h2>
        <img src="image/focusco/proto1.png" alt="">
        <p>In this prototype, we specificly focus on the design of the <span>monitoring</span> system. Ideally, we want
            the app be able to manage the notification setting of the phone and let users to decide choose which apps to
            notify them during the focuing time and turn off the rest. We want to implement a function like guided
            access of iPhone that fix users on the current screen unless they take a break or quit. Correspondingly, we
            design the break ticket that allow users to choose the number of breaks and the duration of each one to
            balance work and rest. A todo list is also included incase user need that.</p>
        <h2>Prototype 2</h2>
        <img src="image/focusco/proto2.png" alt="">
        <p>In prototype 2, we focus on the design of the motivation system. We use a concept of a company and users
            starts from interns and get promoted as they use the app for longer time. We encourage users to invite
            friends and compete with them and have a ranking system to motivate themselves and increase the frequency of
            using this app.
        </p>
        <p>We also implement the study group concept in this app, which are basiclly project managers that can assign
            tasks to members in the group and have them report the progress.</p>

        <h1>Time to test them!</h1>
        <p>Since all group members locate in different city (even countries), we decided to use zoom to interact
            virtually with the testers. We made a power slides with every page on its own slide. The tester will tell us
            which button to click and we will show the corresponding page or popup window. We have 6 people from other
            groups to test our prototypes
            Each tester will 'interact' with both prototypes and give us scores based on <span>Jakob Nielsen's 10
                general
                principles for interaction design</span>:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Visibility of system status</li>
            <li>Match between system and the real world</li>
            <li>User control and freedom</li>
            <li>Consistency and standards</li>
            <li>Error prevention</li>
            <li>Recognition rather than recall</li>
            <li>Flexibility and efficiency of use</li>
            <li>Aesthetic and minimalist design</li>
            <li>Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors</li>
            <li>Help and documentation</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Issues according to feedback</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Users are confused about the "money" in the proto 2.</li>
            <li>The task setting page of proto 1 are too crowded for them.</li>
            <li>They are confused about the break ticket in proto 1 at the first time.</li>
            <li>The plus buttons in proto 2 are confusing and the position of back button should be uniform.</li>
            <li>We don't have enough documentation to guide users.</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Semi-HiFi Prototype</h1>
        <img src="image/focusco/hi-fi.png" alt="">
        <p>To experience the demo, view <a style="color: blue;" href="https://focus-comp.herokuapp.com/">Focus Co.</a>
        </p>
        <h2>What's unique about Focus Co.?</h2>
        <p>Focus Co. is <span>light weighted</span>, provide just as much as what students need as a focus monitor.
            It can strictly monitor phone usage during study and also motivate people to stay focus and "earn money".
        </p>

        <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row;">
            <div style="width: 50%;"><img src="image/focusco/clock.png" alt=""></div>
            <div style="width: 50%;">
                <p>
                    In our design, users are only allowed to leave the screen during break time. Early quit will cause
                    half of their effort been taken away. This level of strictness will be useful to help people who
                    want
                    to stay focus but get cannot reject the lure of internet.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <h1>Reflection</h1>
        <p>The most important thing that I learned from this project is <span>Don't be idealized</span>. Before user
            testing, we
            all feel good about our prototype and we believe they are easy to understand. It turns out that user may not
            even get the
            core concept about some feature in the app. Also, users are more picky than we thought and there is indeed a
            gap between
            designers and users. <span>We really need user tests to make sure user understand our design.</span>
        </p>
        <p>Another thing is we cannot be too idealized about the function of an app. For Focus Co., we want it to be
            able to change
            notification settings of other apps and fix user on the current screen. Those two features are hardly
            possible to actually
            implement. Idea is just idea, <span>Designers need to learn to compromise and give in, either for business
                value or
                technique difficulties.</span>
        </p>
    </div>
