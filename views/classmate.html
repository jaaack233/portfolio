            <h1>How we started</h1>
            <p>
                We've been hearing students complain about having problem talk to classmates extracurricularly over and
                over. Every start of the semester is full of <b>anxiety</b> due to unable to find classmates especially
                in
                the online lecturing circumstance. Although communication platforms like <b>piazza</b> or
                <b>campuswire</b>
                are often utilized by class faculties as official communication tool for the class, students also need
                another place to <b>talk more casually</b>
                instead of posting questions on the forum. There are many choices for such a place, for example
                <b>discord</b>,
                messenger, snapchat, wechat. However, it's quite difficult to find the chat group since students have to
                be
                invited or create one and invite others they know from the class. Me and my friends have been struggling
                for three years and now we want to make some changes.
            </p>
            <h1>Key Problems</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>Students don't have an easy access to communicate with other classmates besides who know in class.
                </li>
                <li>Current platforms like campuswire or piazza cannot fullfill students' need for free talking.</li>
                <li>Other message app are not official and require invitation from others, which might be a problem for
                    students who know nobody in those groups.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h1>Prior Research:</h1>
        <h2>What do students have?</h2>
        <p>
            The most common apps that college students use to communicate with others can be devided into 2 categories:
            <b>Forums</b> like piazza and campuswire, <b>chatrooms</b> like discord, messenger, etc. Forums are usually
            authorized as official communication platform by professors and chatrooms are established by students and
            spread in small scales. Group chatroom in apps like messenger won't be very large, usually just several
            close friends or group members from the same class. Chanels in discord are more public and some famous one can
            contain many students from the same major.
        </p>

        <h2>What do they want?</h2>
        <p>To better understand the pain points of the group and setup the priority of the functions for the first stage 
            of development, we conducted a survey including following questions:</p>
        <ul style="font-style: italic; color: royalblue;">
            <li>What class communicational platform are you currently using?</li>
            <li>How do you feel about the apps you are using currently? </li>
            <li>How are you finding classmates to talk or work with currently? </li>
            <li>Whats your attitude towards having an app that can help you find classmates?</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>And we ask them to rate following potential features of our app on a scale of 1-10:</h3>
        <ul style="font-style: italic; color: royalblue;">
            <li>Add classmates as friends</li>
            <li>Create and join study rooms</li>
            <li>Save files and posts</li>
            <li>Form group chat with selected members</li>
            <li>Friends recommendation system</li>
            <li>Calendar</li>
            <li>Show class schedule</li>
            <li>A forum to share knowledge and files</li>
        </ul>

                    According to the responses we received from more than 30 survey participants, most people talk/work 
                    with <b>exsisting friends</b> in the same class. There are also a amount of students make friends during 
                    <b>zoom breakout rooms</b> or from <b>assigned teams</b> and from <b>class websites</b> like 
                    piazza/campuswire/slack.
