            <h1>How we started</h1>
            <p>
                Since the outbreak of COVID-19, a lot of consumers have started to choose DoorDash and similar food
                delivery services. Their “no-contact” delivery service helped with the pandemic situation to make users
                feel more secure while accessing the wide variety of food in local restaurants. Generally, users can use
                Doordash to order foods from local restaurants, buy groceries online, and they even provide retail
                shopping services. As there are more users choosing the online delivery service, our team is interested
                in discovering the problems in the user experience of using such mobile apps; we chose Doordash
                specifically, because we want to improve it based on our personal experience compared to its other
                competitors.
            </p>
            <h2>Story 1</h1>
                <p>
                    One of our teammates was very disappointed with a dinner order. It was 8 PM in the evening and she’s
                    waiting for the dasher to deliver her order and the dasher called her to pick up the food. However,
                    the
                    dasher gave the food to the wrong person and left. The dinner was worth 70 dollars, and she had to
                    contact customer service. The customer service was not able to contact the dasher. In the end, the
                    Doordash customer service had to reorder the same food items again for her and she waited another
                    hour.
                </p>
                <h2>Story 2</h2>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 40px;">
                    I once used the grocery shopping feature of DoorDash and I ordered many heavy groceries. Consider
                    the
                    weight of the order, I gave a lot tip to the dasher. However, due to the faliure of the app, the
                    dasher
                    was not able to replace items that were out of stock. It turned out only a few groceries were
                    delivered
                    to me and I regret for that amount of tip.
                </p>

        <h1>How's our peers' experience with DoorDash?</h1>
        <p>
            Due to the short amount of time we have for this project and pandemic, the primary source of data we
            collected
            are all from our peers who are aged around 18-25. Most of these users don’t use DoorDash very often but have
            used it regardless. Most users described using DoorDash for specifically food delivery services and a small
            amount for grocery service. We found that 25% of our survey respondents described encountering in-app issues
            when utilizing DoorDash. We specified in-app issues as being ‘lack of function’ and ‘confusion’. We gave
            respondents a place to describe these issues in the next question and we found that many had ‘app crashes’
            and “promo offer bugs” while using DoorDash. When asking about dasher experiences, some users experienced
            wrong deliveries, incorrect orders, and missing items. Although some of these issues are system issues,
            there are ways to facilitate that these issues don’t happen through the app.

                        Starting from screen 5, when dasher confirms the order delivery on their app, user will receive

                        notification saying that the dasher has confirmed the delivery and also asks if the user has
                        received the food. If the user hit “YES,” they will be directed to screen 6 to rate the
                        restaurant
                        and dasher, or report any issues they’ve met; they’re also offered a second chance to tip the
                        dasher
                        if they feel like tipping the dasher again. If the user didn’t receive the food, they will be

                    <p style="text-align: center;">

                        This is our first prototype. It starts off with the order summary/progress and there’s
                        options to call and text dasher and an option state when you receive your order. After you
                        click “order received”, it prompts you to an after experience questionnaire asking your
                        experience on order and dasher, a space to give an additional tip, and if there were any
                        issues with their order. Each of the other screens pertain to the issues that the user
                        experienced. <b>This resolves some communication issues because there is a double confirmation
                            barrier where order delivery is not only one sided towards the driver, it is now also the
                            user confirming that everything went smoothly.</b> If it did not go smoothly, the user is
                        able
                        to communicate which aspect did not go well.

                <div style="justify-content: center;">
                    <p style="text-align: center;">
                        This prototype focuses on having a double check window for the user when the dasher delivers the
                        food. This is designed to prevent the errors or any mistakes the dasher may have, such as
                        delivering the food to another place, the users can call them right away instead of going back
                        and forth with customer service. Compared to the first prototype, this prototype focuses on the
                        delivery process more instead of rating. As you can see in order page 2 and 5, users can declare
                        if they have physically received the food after the dasher delivers the food. If they choose
                        “yes,” they will be directed to the the rating page and they get to choose to tip the dashers
                        after the service ends. The goal of this prototype is to make users more comfortable with
                        knowing where the food is at. As in our user research, there are examples of dashers sending the
                        food to somewhere else or the food is never delivered. The check-in window (order page 2) should
                        make users to get their food much more quickly and it prevents the Dasher’s mistakes.

                the Dasher when they had the opportunity. We decided to get rid of the “service” issue due to a lot of
                confusion in our first round of user testing.</p>

                        This alternative version allows users to provide immediate feedback after receiving the
                        order. Compared to the one obove, it doesn’t have a report issue section, and it may better
                        motivates
                        users to submit their feedback. It also gives has an avatar image for both dasher and the
                        restaurant
                        to make the reviewing process better recalled. Reviewing for dashers will be easier as the main
                        points were summarized in bubbles and users can also slide the bar to adjust the after-tipping
                        or
                        customizing amounts of tips. For the restaurant’s review, users can view what they ordered from
                        the
                        restaurant and choose “likes” or “dislikes” for the items they ordered.

                <ul>
                    <li>The wording “Order Experience” on the rating screen was not clear or specific enough to know

                    <li>
                        The alternative was a bit more personal with the dasher picture and name
                    </li>
                    <li>they are rating and tipping their experience before they are able to report issues. This can
                        cause the user to be biased and not give good ratings</li>
                    <li>UI Style not following original design system</li>
                    <li>Rating page too long</li>

            Solution</h2>
        <p style="text-align:center">Taking in all this feedback, we overall decided to combine our original and alternative rating screen (seen
            in first before and after). We took out the “report issues” section and integrated it into their own
            respective section within their rating screen. To do that, we had to have different screens for both
            restaurant rating and dasher rating. In addition, some users liked how the alternative had sections for
            positive feedback that the original did not have, so we added spots where users are able to express what
            went right. Similar to the DoorDash app at the moment, when a user rates the dasher, different options and
            feedback will appear depending on the amount of stars.</p>

                <h2>Order not received</h2>
                <p>If the user didn't receive the order, he will be directed to a page to contact the dasher or customer
                    serive. Unlike the current DoorDash design where user cannot reach dasher once the order is completed
                    by the dasher.
                </p>
                <p>Once the dasher delivered the order, user can click on the confirm button to proceed to rating.</p>

                <h2>Rating</h2>
                <p>The rating process is divided into 2 screens. Each screen combines comments and issue reporting that
                    the user don't need to find customer serivce after rating. The operation time for this rating is longer
                    than the current design but will be more detailed to improve communication.
