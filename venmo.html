            <h1>Background</h1>
            <p>
                Venmo is a very popular money transaction app among young people. Unlike many other apps that require a
                bank account, it’s independ digital account makes money transactions extremely convenient between
                friends. It’s just like a digital wallet that you can put your changes in. However, not all the people
                are enjoying using venmo: at least all the members from our group agree that venmo’s interface is bad.
                We often find ourselves making mistakes while using venmo no matter how long we’ve used it. Something
                needs to be improved for venmo.
            </p>
            <h1>Problem</h1>
            <p>
                <b>Venmo’s user interface and user experience needs to be improved so users can operate more
                    efficiently.</b>
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <p class="sec-intro">Let's observe how other users interact with venmo in real situations</p>
            <h2>Methodology</h2>
            <p>
                The goal of our data collection was to understand and figure out
                the errors that users make when it comes to using Venmo. We will
                apply the <b>Master-Apprentice Model</b> to observe how the users
                understand and interact with Venmo.
            </p>
            <p>
                Those who were interviewed were college students with no specific demographics, and picked
                at random. Most interviews were conducted on campus and was a one to one meeting.
                The interviewer asked a random person if they had the Venmo app and asked to take part in
                an interview. Then the interviewer proceeded to ask questions before asking the interviewee
                to complete a task (request and send money to interviewer). This whole interview process,
                like stated above, helped the data collection go smoothly as we were able to observe the
                interviewee and analyze what slips/mistakes they made during the task portion of the interview.
            </p>
            <b>1. What are your general thoughts about Venmo?</b>
            <p>
                This question will be used to get the opinions that people have about Venmo. It could also be
                a guiding question that could help us find out whether or not they like this product. Since we
                are trying to redesign this app, having this question will let us know about the structure of
                their mental model. This will also help us find out what the most important features are for
                the users. On the other hand, this question will also let us know features about the product
                that the user doesn’t like allowing us to find the root of the problems people have when
                interacting with this app.
            </p>
            <b>2. How long have you been using Venmo? Why did you start using Venmo?</b>
            <p>
                Asking these questions will give us a better idea about how well the person knows the app,
                and help us guide them into talking about their journey with Venmo and how their knowledge
                about this app has changed over time. Having this question would inform us about the evolution
                of their mental model of the application.
            </p>
            <b>3. When and where did you last use Venmo?</b>
            <p>
                People use Venmo for a variety of reasons, and with this question, we would be able to extract
                how often people engage with the app. Whether it be needing to pay someone, or waiting for
                someone to pay you back, understanding the user’s reasoning for using the app will be very
                important to our redesign.
            </p>
            <b>4. Do you know any other apps similar to Venmo?</b>
            <p>
                These questions are used to see other apps that people know of, and how these apps have morphed
                their mental models. In addition, asking them these questions will also let us know if they prefer
                certain features of one app over the other. Things such as having better navigation, connection
                to banks, and popularity are a couple of the characteristics we are expecting when people describe
                these apps. We are also looking to see what features properly bridge the gulf of execution in a
                transaction app.
            </p>
            <b>5. PROCESS</b>
            <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
                <ul
                    style="background-color: rgb(162, 188, 236); border-radius: 20px; list-style: none; padding: 20px; text-align: center;">
                    <li>Have them request from us —> Ask them to locate this request</li>
                    <li>We complete the request</li>
                    <li>We request our money back —> Ask them to locate our request</li>
                    <li>Have them complete our request</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="block">

                <div>
                    <h2 style="margin-left: 40px;">Why this way?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Easier to see where and how possible errors are made when requesting or sending money through
                        Venmo.
                        This form of collecting data is known as the Master-Apprentice model.
                        This process helps us understand which users are more accustomed to using venmo
                        and which are less avid with its’ various functions.
                        Lets us see a users mental model of the app and how their gulf of
                        execution is enacted, and then how their gulf of evaluation is either met, or if not, then how
                        they
                        decide to go back to the gulf of execution.
                    </p>

                    <p>After completing the processes, we asked follow up questions about any errors we find that the
                        user
                        had committed. This is to understand their mental model much better and distinguish what type of
                        error the user made. What may have appeared as a Knowledge-Based Mistake may have actually been
                        a
                        Memory-Lapse Mistake because the user was stressed from having their screen being recorded.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <h2>What are the common errors?</h2>
            <div class="block">
                <img src="image/venmo/venmo_2.gif" alt="">
                <P>According to the interview data, most common errors that interviewees made are <b>Memory-Lapse
                        Slip</b>,
                    <b>Description-Similarity Slip</b> and <b>Knowledge-based Mistake</b>. For the Memory-Lapse slip,
                    most
                    interviewees made this error because they forget to add notes before sending the pay/request.
                    There are also situations that they forget to enter money amount or just forget where to find
                    the correct interface due to panic because of the screen capture. For this type of error, users have
                    the correct mental model to complete the task but due to some memory lapse, they forget some steps.
                </P>

            </div>
            <div class="block">
                <img src="image/venmo/venmo_3.gif" alt="">
                <P>For the <b>Description-Similarity Slip</b>, due to the similarity of the process, users may
                    automatically do
                    the operations that they usually do. In the interview, one user click “pay” instead of “request”
                    because she usually click “pay”. Another interviewee try to find the payment under
                    “incomplete” section but it’s actually not there. Interviewees who make this type of slips also have
                    correct mental model for how to use this app but because they are doing another similar process too
                    often, they automatically repeat that process for another similar but not exact task. </P>

            </div>
            <div class="block">
                <img src="image/venmo/venmo_4.gif" alt="">
                <P>The most common error is <b>knowledge-based mistake</b>, which takes about <b>44%</b> of all errors.
                    For this
                    error, interviewees just simply don’t know where the correct tab is and start to randomly tapping
                    familiar tabs to guess. This is a mistake because users do not have a correct mental
                    model for the product because they are lack of knowledge to the product and there is no good system
                    image to gap the gulf of execution. There are also some small mistakes like rule-based mistake, in
                    which user don’t know the rules of the decimal point in venmo by thinking it would be added on
                    automatically and turn out put in 0.1 instead of 0.01. That is a mistake because they are using the
                    wrong method to enter number, which means users don’t have the correct mental model to interact with
                    this function.</P>

            </div>

            <h2>Pattern & Trends</h2>
            <div class="block">
                <img src="image/venmo/venmo_5.png" alt="">
                <p>We had a small sample size of 19 people. It is important to note that we also had 9 Android users and
                    10 Apple users. The user interfaces between the both are slightly different from each other, so in
                    order to “even the playing field” we tried to interview each one an even amount of times. It is also
                    important to note that we interviewed ages ranging from 19 - 24 (general college ages); however, a
                    majority of those interviewed were of the same age group (19-years-old). It is possible that this
                    may have affected our data because they’ve been using venmo for a shorter period of time compared to
                    other users. Not only that, but only 3 of our 19 interviewees could be considered “new” users (under
                    1 year of use) meaning that our data involves experienced users. While this may not be a huge issue;
                    this may have interfered with us learning how people learn how to find and us these specific
                    features. </p>

            </div>

            <div class="block">
                <p>Despite this, the plot shows that no matter how experienced a user is, there is still room for
                    error. It is thought that with experience comes less errors; however, looking at the stacked bar
                    graph it appears that the users who used have been using the app longer actually made more errors.
                    This information is crucial because it suggests that even avid users are making errors, thus showing
                    that the problem with these errors aren’t merely human mistakes, but are mistakes caused by a poorly
                    designed financial app. This is not to say that Venmo is a bad app, but rather that Venmo can be
                    improved to minimize the mistakes which even avid users find themselves making. In order to minimize
                    the errors made, it is important to understand where the problem lays. In this case, Venmo’s
                    application design is the problem linked to these errors. </p>

                    <p>
                        Younger interviewees had been using Venmo for a shorter
                        period of time in comparison to the other age groups, who a majority appear to have been using
                        it for 3 or more years (with a couple exceptions). When asked how long they had been using the
                        application, some first responded with “When I started college” and then followed with an
                        estimate of how many years it would be. Despite Venmo being founded in 2009, it appears that
                        Venmo only becomes known to an audience once they are around college age.
                    </p>

                    <p>This is further backed by where we got an estimate “Starting Age” by subtracting
                        each user’s length of usage by their respective ages. As shown, it appears that a majority of
                        users began around the ages of 17-18 which would be considered freshman year of college. </p>

                    There were 5 more occurrences where the interviewees clearly stated “I don’t know where it is” but
                    were not listed as a Knowledge-Based Mistake because they were able to navigate their way to the
                    specified feature without making an error.

                    Another common error done is the Memory-Lapse Slip. This slip happened 4 times total evenly between
                    both Apple and Android and was for the same reason: forgetting to add a note when requesting a
                    payment. This leads us to wonder if having a note be required was necessary, or if it should be
                    optional.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There also appears to be more errors occuring for the Android interface (11 errors) in comparison to
                    the Apple interface (7 errors). Additionally, more types of errors appeared from the Android
                    interface: Capture Slip, Description Similarity, and Memory Lapse. Description Similarity Slip was
                    the most common out of the three, and second most common out of all types of errors for Android.
                    This may have something to do with the application’s interface due to both applications functions
                    working in very similar ways but having different locations and icons.

                    When it comes to money, people often have different priorities when using transaction apps. As a
                    designer,
                    it’s not always your job to fulfill every request of every user, but to figure out what people
                    prioritize
                    in order to optimize your product. Let's take a look at some popular transaction apps and analyze
                    <b>Why
                        are they designed in that way.
                    </b>
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="block">
                <div style="width: 40%;">
                    <img style="width: 100%; max-width: 100%; max-height: auto;" src="image/venmo/zelle.png" alt="">
                </div>
                <div style="width: 60%; ">
                    <p>
                        <b>Zelle</b>'s UI is designed in very virant color. In order for user’s to make sure they are
                        paying the
                        right users, phone numbers are directly attached to someone’s account, so there is no need to
                        figure
                        out if you’re paying the right person, since their phone number will prove that it’s them right
                        away.
                        Compared to Venmo, being able to connect contacts to your account creates <b>trust between the
                            user and the
                            company</b>, since it shows that they prioritize this factor in a transaction app. Another
                        feature that caused
                        one of our interviewees to prefer Zelle over Venmo, is the fact that once you pay someone or get
                        paid,
                        it goes <b>straight onto a bank account</b>, instead of sitting in the app as “Venmo Cash.” This
                        instant transfer
                        is convenient for people who need the money right away, and saves them from having to wait for
                        their money.To add on,
                        often times Zelle is already included in your banking apps, so you don’t even need to download
                        this app in order to use Zelle.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="block">

                    <p>
                        Similar to Zelle, <b>CashApp</b> also gives off a minimal feel along with the vibrant color. It
                        prioritizes the user and their goals of trying to send or receive money from people.
                        Another comparable feature is that it affords for the user to be able to check stocks. 
                        This app seems to target those who <b>own stocks</b>, or those who are <b>looking into getting involved in
                            the stock market</b> . CashApp even allows users to purchase stocks through their app. Another
                        feature that’s included is the ability to exchange Bitcoin.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="block">
                <div style="width: 40%;">
                    <img style="width: 100%; max-width: 100%; max-height: auto;" src="image/venmo/facebook.png" alt="">

                <div style="width: 60%; ">
                    <p>
                        Similar to Zelle, <b>Facebook Messenger</b> allows the user to confirm that they’re sending money to the 
                        right user immediately, since they are going to be sending it to a person that they’re already friends with on Facebook.
                        Although this seems like a very accessible and user-friendly feature, we believe that users don’t use it as much because 
                        of the fact that no one’s really used to paying someone through a messenger app. Snapchat also included this feature, 
                        but once it was introduced, many people never even heard about it again.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What I have to mention is that <b>WeChat</b> is also a messenger app but is is one of the two most popular transaction
                        apps in China along with Alipay. What makes Wechat stands out is a small function called "Red Envelop", which fit with Chinese
                        tranditional culture and Spring Festival. Wechat is successful since it finds its special <b>Payment scenario</b>, and
                        fullfill user's need to giving money in a more <b>cultural and casual</b> way.

                        <b>ApplePay</b> is ran by Apple and also very convenient for iPhone users. The app is designed to help 
                        iPhone users easily transfer money between each other. Apple pay works similar to Venmo in the sense that 
                        it can keep the money within the app, but can also transfer the money to a user’s personal bank account. 
                        The difference however, lies in that Venmo is universal while apple pay’s main focus is iPhone users/ Apple Devices.

            <h2>Centralizing the Requests</h2>
            <p>Since out of our <b>19</b> interviewees, <b>12</b> of them had issues trying to figure out where the existing requests
                were. The most confusing part for them was trying to distinguish between the requests that they received
                and the requests they sent.</p>
            <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row;">
                <div style="width: 25%;"><img src="image/venmo/venmo_14.gif" alt="" style="width: 100%;"></div>
                <div style="width: 25%;">
                    <p>This is the current UI of the Venmo app, that shows how to see what people have requested from
                        you.
                        As you can see, this is separated from the requests that you have sent other people. This has
                        lead
                        to confusion among users because they either mix up the two or don’t understand at all where to
                        find
                        what they need.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div style="width: 25%;"><img src="image/venmo/venmo_15.gif" alt="" style="width: 100%;"></div>
                <div style="width: 25%;">
                    <p>This is our redesign of the current Venmo feature. We decided to centralize the request feature,
                        to decrease confusion. To further distinguish between the types of request, we changed the
                        colors of the amount of money being requested.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>The change we made was to create a tab called “requests,” to stick to the language used when dealing with
                the requests people send and receive. Having a centralized area would make it easier for
                users to navigate and understand where to find what they need, without having to guess where it is. To
                further distinguish between the requests sent and received, we also changed the colors of the amount of
                money being requested. If you are sent a request, the color is red, signifying that you will be losing
                money. The requests that a user sends out would be colored in green since they are gaining that money.
                We believe that this would allow the app to be able to empathize with the users, since using this app
                should be quick and easy.
            </p>

            <h2>Simplifying the Side Bar</h2>
            <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; margin-top: 30px;">
                <div style="width: 25%;"><img src="image/venmo/venmo_16.png" alt="" style="width: 90%;"></div>
                <div style="width: 25%;"><img src="image/venmo/venmo_17.png" alt="" style="width: 90%;"></div>
                <div style="width: 50%;">
                    <p>The existing sidebar of the Venmo app had a lot going on, and we believe this also contributed to
                        the
                        fact that people weren’t able to find where their existing requests were, since the signifiers
                        weren’t
                        properly communicating what they did, and wasn’t bridging the gulf of execution.In order to
                        mitigate
                        these errors, we decided to simplify the menu bar, by only keeping the Home, Requests, Payments,
                        and
                        Venmo Card options. We also decided to only keep the symbols for the help and settings windows
                        since
                        these symbols are fairly universal, and will be familiar to most users. We also decided to
                        remove the
                        “search people” because the user can already access this through the payment section, and having
                        it in
                        two different places may confuse them.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>


            <h2>Changing the Pay and Request Features</h2>
            <p>Another feature that 3 out of our 19 interviewees had was confusing the Pay and Request buttons. It is
                more common for people to use the “pay” button, so as a Capture Slip, one of our interviewees pressed
                “pay” instead of “request” because that was what they were used to doing. In order to emphasize whether
                or not the user needs to pay or request from someone, we decided to add a lock-in to allow the user to
                confirm who exactly they want to interact with, and what they’re trying to do. We also included an
                option to change their option to payment or request. We prioritized this because we know that once a
                user pays someone, they’re not able to cancel your payment, and the user would have to ask that person
                to pay you back since the user made a mistake. In addition, we also increased the font for the amount of
                money you’re sending, and who you’re sending to. We decided that this would be a good idea because 2 of
                our users accidentally typed out the wrong amount of money to send, and this would be troublesome for
                users, since there is no way to go back. This also decreased the amount of whitespace available to
                describe what the transaction is. We decreased it because 5 out of 19 interviewees forgot to add a note,
                which shows that describing what the transaction is, is not a priority for the user
            </p>
            <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row;">
                <div style="width: 25%;"><img src="image/venmo/venmo_18.png" alt="" style="width: 100%;"></div>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        This is Venmo’s current interface when it comes to paying or requesting from someone. People
                        usually slip up when they forget to add a note, or pay instead of request.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row;">

                <div style="width: 50%;">
                    <p>This is the redesign for the options to request. As you can see, the user now has the ability to
                        choose whether or not they request or need to pay someone before entering the window where they
                        input all of the other details</p>
                </div>
            </div>


            <div>
                <h2>Removing the “Public” Feed</h2>
                <p>The Public Feed portion of the Venmo app is set up to be similar to a social media app. Any
                    transaction a
                    user does is automatically set up as public, thus showing anyone on Venmo a user’s transactions on
                    the
                    app. However, these transactions can be set to “friends only” (people who friend you on Venmo are
                    the
                    only ones able to see this transaction), and “private” (only you and the other person in the money
                    transfer can see this transaction). <b>While this feature is liked by some users, many people who
                        were
                        interviewed stated they were not comfortable with the automatic public feed feature of
                        Venmo.</b>
                    Additionally, <b>there are no signifiers clearly showing the users how to change the public feature
                        and set
                        it to private or friends only.</b> This makes it even more difficult for user’s to keep their
                    transactions
                    private. When it comes to money, some people like to keep their transactions private and therefore
                    don’t
                    like the idea that their personal finances are public. By removing the “Public” Feed feature of the
                    Venmo app we make the app more private and better for users who prefer to keep their finances away
                    from
                    the public.
                    Another reason for the removal of the Public Feed feature on Venmo is that it would help clear up
                    space
                    for the more important features that Venmo offers. Rather than showing other people’s transactions
                    in
                    the Public Feed, this area can be changed to just showing the user all of their own transactions.
                    This
                    makes the app design seem less cluttered and helps signify more relevant app features of Venmo. This
                    redesign also allows for users to clearly see what transactions they have made in the past and helps
                    keep their transactions visible and easy to manage; they no longer have to hunt down where to find
                    past
                    transactions. Additionally, with the simplification of this design, it clears up any need for
                    additional
                    signifiers to show where to find past transactions.

            <h1>Reflection</h1>
            <P>
                This is the first project I've done in the field of UIUX design and the project is very focused on user
                research. When I'm writing this words down, it's already 2 years after completing the project. At the moment,
                I'm pondering the relationship between <b>Product</b> and <b>User Experience</b>. Although Venmo's user
                experience is not very good, there are still many users using that app. I think the reason is that <b>Venmo can
                    meet those users' goals</b> and <b>users can compromise to UIUX design that are not very good if the function is good.</b>
                However, if I become a designer in the future, <b>I will try to create products as art pieces constantly refine user
                experience.</b>
