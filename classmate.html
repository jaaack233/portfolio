            <h1>What is ClassHouse?</h1>
            <p>ClassHouse is a platform tool combines multiple features to helps college students to connect and study.
                The features build into ClassHouse include <b>Group chat</b>, <b>Friend system</b>, and <b>Planning</b>.
            </p>


            <h1>How we started</h1>
            <p>
                We've been hearing students complain about having problem talk to classmates extracurricularly over and
                over. Every start of the semester is full of <b>anxiety</b> due to unable to find classmates especially
                in
                the online lecturing circumstance. Although communication platforms like <b>piazza</b> or
                <b>campuswire</b>
                are often utilized by class faculties as official communication tool for the class, students also need
                another place to <b>talk more casually</b>
                instead of posting questions on the forum. There are many choices for such a place, for example
                <b>discord</b>,
                messenger, snapchat, wechat. However, it's quite difficult to find the chat group since students have to
                be
                invited or create one and invite others they know from the class. Me and my friends have been struggling
                for three years and now we want to make some changes.
            </p>

            <h1>Key Problems</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>Students don't have an easy access to communicate with other classmates besides who know in class.
                </li>
                <li>Current platforms like campuswire or piazza cannot fullfill students' need for free talking.</li>
                <li>Other message app are not official and require invitation from others, which might be a problem for
                    students who know nobody in those groups.</li>
            </ul>



            <h1>Core Functions</h1>
            <h2>The Homepage</h2>
            <div class="block">
                <div style="width: 25%;">
                    <img src="image/classmate/home0.png" alt="">
                </div>
                <div style="width: 50%; padding: 10px;">
                    <p>
                        There are three blocks on the home page: <b>Class Schedule</b>, <b>Course Portal</b>,
                        <b>Notification</b>. The first thing students need to do is cliking the button highlighted in
                        the figure
                        to add courses for the semester. In our design, all courses provided by the university will be
                        preloaded
                        in the database and students and simple join those chanels.
                    </p>
                    <img src="image/classmate/home-search.png" alt="">

                <div style="width: 25%;">

                </div>
            </div>

            <h2>Courses and chanels</h2>
            <div class="block">
                <div style="width: 75%;">

                <div style="width: 25%;">
                    <p>
                        We design the sidebar menu to be "discord-style". It may take some time for users who never used
                        discord
                        before to get used to it but it can simplify the operation for switching between classes and
                        chanels.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <h2>Chat</h2>
            <div class="block">

                </div>
                <div style="width: 30%;">
                    <p>
                        A typical chat chanel has a <b>filter</b> that users can switch between <b>All</b>,
                        <b>Picture</b>,
                        <b>File</b>, and <b>Link</b>. This will help users to browse content faster coordinate with the
                        search function.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We also have <b>Unread Message</b> and <b>New Message</b> notification that user can click to
                        fast
                        navigate to the specific message.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <h2>What's unique about our chat system? Why designed like that?</h2>
            <div class="block">
                <div style="width: 60%;">
                    <img style="width: 80%;" src="image/classmate/chat3.png" alt="">

                    <p>
                        The messages of ClassHouse is a combination of <b>post</b> and <b>casual message</b>. On one
                        hand,
                        users can do free talking, on the other hand, other users can reply to one message right under
                        it
                        just like forums and do other operations like using emoji to response, save posts, pin, copy,
                        and
                        share. This design make conversation easier than in forum by skipping writing title, choosing
                        subject,
                        etc. It's also more condense than normal chat rooms where replies spread everywhere and get
                        interrupted
                        by others.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The messages send by users themselves will have <span style="color: royalblue;">blue</span>
                        background
                        to help users identify. Saved message will have <span style="color: orange;">orange</span>
                        background.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <h2>Join the study groups!</h2>
            <div class="block">
                <div style="width: 65%;">
                    <img style="width: 100%;" src="image/classmate/studygroup.png" alt="">

                <div style="width: 35%;">
                    <p>
                        <b>Study Group</b> is another module under class. Here people can schedule or join study groups,
                        which will be on the public calendar of class. Easy to schedule, easy to join!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Why necessary?</b> Usually students only do group study with friends they already know or
                        simply
                        join the review session hold by TAs or Professors before exam. The way they notify students are
                        by
                        <b>email</b> or <b>posts</b> on the forums. The Study Group function of ClassHouse just make
                        things
                        easier and provides more opportunity for students to make friends with others they don't know
                        yet.

                        Under the <b>Classmate</b> module in each class, user will be able to find a full list of
                        members in the
                        same class and they can send direct message and friend request.

                    <p>
                        Users can see all their friends on the <b>Friends</b> page, which is the second button on the
                        navbar.
                        We design a special function that users can <b>view their friends' schedule</b>. Once our users
                        want to
                        meet up with their friends, they can check their class schedule to decide when/where to meet.

                        Users will also be able to add friends directly by searching their names, major, etc.

        <h2>What do students have?</h2>
        <p>
            The most common apps that college students use to communicate with others can be devided into 2 categories:
            <b>Forums</b> like piazza and campuswire, <b>chatrooms</b> like discord, messenger, etc. Forums are usually
            authorized as official communication platform by professors and chatrooms are established by students and
            spread in small scales. Group chatroom in apps like messenger won't be very large, usually just several
            close friends or group members from the same class. Chanels in discord are more public and some famous one
            can
            contain many students from the same major.
        </p>
        <div><img src="image/classmate/apps.png" alt=""></div>
        <h2>What do they want?</h2>
        <p>To better understand the pain points of the group and setup the priority of the functions for the first stage
            of development, we conducted a survey including following questions:</p>
        <ul style="font-style: italic; color: royalblue;">
            <li>What class communicational platform are you currently using?</li>
            <li>How do you feel about the apps you are using currently? </li>
            <li>How are you finding classmates to talk or work with currently? </li>
            <li>Whats your attitude towards having an app that can help you find classmates?</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>And we ask them to rate following potential features of our app on a scale of 1-10:</h3>
        <ul style="font-style: italic; color: royalblue;">
            <li>Add classmates as friends</li>
            <li>Create and join study rooms</li>
            <li>Save files and posts</li>

                    during

                    Since we used a scale of 1-10, people tend to be neutrual on this type of questions. The mean of
                    ratings
                    could be very close to each other and even small difference means a lot to us.

                        The first version of the class schedule can switch between daily and weekly view. All window
                        needs to
                        be expanded by clicking the arrow button at the bottom to view the complete schedule.

                        From V1 to V2, we dispute the idea of switching between daily and weekly view. Instead, we use
                        color
                        blocks to roughly tell user how many events do they have for each day. The detailed info are
                        listed
                        beblow. <b>No more extra operation needed to view full schedule.</b> We also adjust the color of
                        the
                        module to better fit the theme of our app.

                    <p>
                        Since we are not making a calendar app, we only provide weekday schedule to remind users of
                        their
                        class.

            <h1>Reflection</h1>
            <h2>Work with designers</h2>
            <p>
                It's the first time for me to work with more than 2 UIUX designers and developers team to create a real
                app from scratch.
                In this process, I've encountered many problems that will never appear when simply doing class projects.
                Since I work with
                other 3 excellent designers, it's quite usual for us to argue about different design plan. We create 4
                version of class
                schedule, 3 versions of the sidebar, countless changes on every small components. I feel it very
                enjoyable to listen and
                sharing ideas and I learned a lot from my peers.
            </p>
            <h2>Work with developers</h2>
            <p>
                Working with developers is another challenge since they usually can't perfectly replicate the prototype
                design. I
                used to design and code by myself so there are no problems for me to make product the same as design.
                However,
                ClassHouse is a big app with complicated functions. Our developers
                are still students and they pretty much rely on the exsisting kits to simplify their coding. As
                designers, we need to
                point out issues frequently and make adjustments to the design to compromise with tech issues. I also
                learned to write
                detailed interaction guideline for developers to understand our design. It's a very good experience to
                work with Android developers
                to get familiar with Android design so I'll be ready for future work.
            </p>
            <h2>In the future...</h2>
            <p>
                There are still many issues to cover in the future. For example, how to get API from each school or how
                do we preload all courses
                in the system before each semester begins.
                Our team will keep working on ClassHouse and once it's ready, we hope there are some buyers can keep
                improving this app and
                facilitate all students.
