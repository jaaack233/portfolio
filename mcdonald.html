            <h1>How we started</h1>
            <p>
                The process of ordering food at a fast-food restaurant is supposed to be quick and easy, but with high
                demand creating long lines, the process has become more difficult and frustrating. In order to resolve
                this issue and create an efficient and easy way to order, McDonald’s created a kiosk. These kiosks allow
                customers to order their food manually by touching a screen. In theory, the idea of a kiosk is a great
                one that should work, but unfortunately, there are many issues that come with it. All of our group
                members
                had bad experience at the McDonald's at Nobel Dr. near UCSD, especially with the kiosks.
            </p>
            <h1>Key Problems</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>People often make mistakes while using the kiosks.</li>
                <li>The mistakes and confusions slow down ordering process.</li>
                <li>Kiosk are not actually more convinient than ordering with cashier.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>

        <h1>Find out the detailed issues:</h1>
        <h2>Methodology</h2>
        <p>
            Our first attempts at data collection were done using a <b>Master-Apprentice</b> Method of focused
            observation.
            We sought to carefully observe user experience with the kiosk in two ways.
        </p>

            <div style="width: 60%; display: flex; align-items: center;">
                <p style='padding-top: 10px; padding-bottom: 10px; font-size: 25px;'>
                    Our first method of gathering data was to speak to the consumer directly and give them tasks in
                    order to
                    get a full range of activity on the kiosk. We will also record our volunteers' operation with their
                    and
                    McDonald's permission. Due to the project nature, we only conduct <b>15</b> surveys and interviews.

                <p style='padding: 20px; font-size: 25px;'>
                    Since we can't guarantee all interviewees will let us record their operation, we make a alternative
                    plan,
                    which is everyone observe and mark down the errors they made.

                    Among the errors we collected from 15 participants, the most common errors are <b>mistapping</b>,
                    <b>lagging</b>, and <b>can't find items</b>. The occurance of these errors are quite high that
                    nearly everyone
                    made once.

                        <b>Situation 1:</b> users tapped the wrong place by accident, then they tapped the right place
                        to finish the
                        intended action. For example, as shown in Gif, user WZ was asked to order a “10pcs McNuggets
                        Meal''.
                        After he clicked on the item, a window popped up asking “would you like to add-on”. Instead of
                        tapping the
                        “make it a meal” button, he tapped the “just the item” button. He then realized that he clicked
                        the wrong button
                        and returned to the previous step immediately.

                    <p style="padding: 50px;">
                        <b>Situation 2:</b> the kiosks’ screens aren’t very sensitive to the touches so sometimes they
                        won’t react to gentle touches,
                        so users have to touch the screen multiple times to elicit kiosks’ responses. As shown in Gif,
                        user WZ’s first tap
                        wasn’t sensed by the kiosk, so he had to tap harder on the screen to make it respond.

                        <b> 12 of the 15</b> interviewees experience these problems during the tasks.
                        In the designer’s mental model, users can go straight to the correct category to find
                        what they want. However in reality, users reported that they didn’t know which categories
                        the items were in, so they had to look through multiple categories to find the items.
                        For example, we found that <b>all 15</b> interviewees have a hard time looking for hash browns
                        and only <b>5</b> were able to locate them. This trend occurs because hash browns are not in any
                        categories listed on the left side of the screen, and users have to go to the home screen
                        and then go to the “All Day Breakfast” category to find it.

                        where to find the tent cards. Before checking out, users were asked to “Grab a Table tend and
                        enter
                        the code” (Figure 2.3). However, the kiosks didn't tell users where the tent cards were and what
                        code to enter, and there’s no option to skip this step and continue to checkout (nothing
                        happened
                        if the users tapped the “Continue” button without entering a code). The kiosks also told nothing
                        about how and where to pick up drinks, creating confusion for the users.

                <p>The new design of landing screen is pretty similar to origin one but with extra singage.</p>
                <p>
                    We increased the ‘home button’ size to reduce confusion and mistaps. Next we added a search function. 
                    The original ‘Home’ menu contained links to popular menus, but we found that it was less confusing if 
                    we placed these with the rest of the menus on the left 
                    bar. We then enlarged the ‘Popular Items’ list to take up the rest of the home screen. This 
                    would help reduce Time Consumption if you were ordering a common item.  
                    Furthermore we modified the left bar categories to add breakfast and combined the ‘Sweets’ and ‘Bakery’ category into one.

                    A prototype of the ‘Sandwiches & Meals’ menu. This new format would be applied to the rest of 
                    the menus. We improved the organization by ordering food by category (Beef, chicken, etc.). 
                    Whilst with the original kiosk, the user could filter by meat, the ‘All’ tab, 
                    which was default, had no organization to it and was random. Out of Order items would be moved 
                    to the bottom of their category, as compared to the original interface where they were not moved at all.

                    Our new customization screen and pops up after selecting an item. The main change we made is merging 
                    the entire customization procedure into one screen. This should significantly reduce Time Consumption 
                    whether or not the user is actually customizing their burger. 
                    Previously the sequence was: Meal/No Meal, Add to Order/Customize, Customize, Add to Order/Customize. 
                    Previously the minimum number of taps (No meal, no customization) needed was two, now it is one. 
                    We also added a ‘Notes’ function for options that are not available or special requests.

                    An illustration of our physical space prototype. We added two signs that hang off the back of the kiosk. 
                    The top sign points towards the cups and the lower communicates clearly to the user that the kiosk does 
                    not take card. We opted to place the signs behind the kiosk rather than on the front because this way 
                    it kept the minimalist aesthetics of the kiosk intact. In addition there was not enough space. 
                    Below the signs is a hand sanitizing station, which users can use after tapping on the screen if they so wish.
