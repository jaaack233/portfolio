        <h1>Background</h1>
        <p>
            Nowadays, most schools in the US are still providing online courses due to the pandemic. We noticed two
            major issues that many students have confronted in such study mode. One is the distraction of
            smartphones. The other is group work coordination. In offline study mode, students are often told to put
            phones away or mute their phones. Also, in a live lecture, students pay more attention since they will
            miss important points about the content. However, when classes are online, students have no restrictions
            on access to their smartphones and they can pause the video at any time they want. This kind of freedom
            magnifies the distraction of smartphones since there are no monitors and the cost for distraction is so
            low.
        </p>
        <h1>Problems</h1>
        <p style="font-size: 30px; color: cornflowerblue;">People in unmonitored circumstance are experiencing
            harder time get rid of the distraction of smartphones. They also experience low motivation for consistant
            working.
        </p>

        <div>
            <h1>Prior Research</h1>
            <p>There are already many attention-monitoring apps in the market, however, there is no such a perfect one
                that
                exactly solve the pain points of people around me. Let's take a look at the most popular two in the
                market:
                "Forest" & "Tomato Todo"
            </p>
            <h2>Forest</h2>
            <img src="image/focusco/forest.png" alt="" style="width: 100%;">

            <p>Forest is an app that build around the countdown clock. When users use the app, they are planting a tree.
                As
                long as the user keep using the app, they will have their own forest with all kinds of trees. </p>
            <h3>Pros.</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Simple but with all necessary functions avaliable like record, achievements, timeline, and options
                    for
                    countdown</li>
                <li>Beautiful and uniform UI that fits the theme of the app</li>
                <li>Succesfully shows users their efforts and gives them <span>sense of achievement</span></li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Cons.</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>New users have to register new account if they want to experience some functions like friends,
                    store,
                    achievements. <span>Third party login not avaliable</span></li>
                <li>Require users to have some extend of self-control ability. Simply wither the tree may not stop user
                    from
                    surfing on internet.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Tomato ToDo</h2>
            <p>Unlike Forest, Tomato ToDo has more functions and become predictably more complicated than forest.
                Unfortunately, Tomato ToDo doesn't have language setting and simplified Chinese is the only language
                avaliable.</p>
            <img src="image/focusco/tomato1.png" alt="" style="width: 100%;">

            <ol style="font-size: 20px;">
                <li>
                    In this app, users can set multiple clocks and there are three type of clocks: Normal, Habit, Goal
                </li>
                <li>Users can create group of clocks</li>
                <li>Basic user stats tracktion</li>
                <li>Highly costumizable settings including appearence, clock, ect.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Countdown pages:</h3>
            <img src="image/focusco/tomato2.png" alt="" style="width: 100%;">

            <p>The countdown clock of Tomato ToDo allow users to pause for a period of time (adjustable in settings),
                keep
                screen on, background music, and quit.
                It has more steps to operate incase user want to quit halfway and require user to reflection on the
                reason.
                If the deep focusing mode is on, when user leave the screen for too long, there will be a alarm to warn
                user.
                <span>This makes the app stronger on monitoring users.</span>
            </p>
            <h3>Pros.</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Powerful, complete functions</li>
                <li>Highly customizable</li>
                <li>Strong monitoring power</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Cons.</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>UI not uniform, UX for setting is a little bit too complicated</li>
                <li>No attractive system to motivate users</li>
                <li>In general feels a little bit heavy</li>
            </ul>


            <h1>Our Ideas</h1>
            <p style="font-size: 30px; color: cornflowerblue;">We want the simplicity of Forest, the monitoring power of
                Tomato ToDo, with the
                function to facilitate and
                motivate group working.</p>
            <h2>Prototype 1</h2>
            <img src="image/focusco/proto1.png" alt="">
            <p>In this prototype, we specificly focus on the design of the <span>monitoring</span> system. Ideally, we
                want
                the app be able to manage the notification setting of the phone and let users to decide choose which
                apps to
                notify them during the focuing time and turn off the rest. We want to implement a function like guided
                access of iPhone that fix users on the current screen unless they take a break or quit. Correspondingly,
                we
                design the break ticket that allow users to choose the number of breaks and the duration of each one to
                balance work and rest. A todo list is also included incase user need that.</p>
            <h2>Prototype 2</h2>
            <img src="image/focusco/proto2.png" alt="">
            <p>In prototype 2, we focus on the design of the motivation system. We use a concept of a company and users
                starts from interns and get promoted as they use the app for longer time. We encourage users to invite
                friends and compete with them and have a ranking system to motivate themselves and increase the
                frequency of
                using this app.
            </p>
            <p>We also implement the study group concept in this app, which are basiclly project managers that can
                assign
                tasks to members in the group and have them report the progress.</p>

            <h1>Time to test them!</h1>
            <p>Since all group members locate in different city (even countries), we decided to use zoom to interact
                virtually with the testers. We made a power slides with every page on its own slide. The tester will
                tell us
                which button to click and we will show the corresponding page or popup window. We have 6 people from
                other
                groups to test our prototypes
                Each tester will 'interact' with both prototypes and give us scores based on <span>Jakob Nielsen's 10
                    general
                    principles for interaction design</span>:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Visibility of system status</li>
                <li>Match between system and the real world</li>
                <li>User control and freedom</li>
                <li>Consistency and standards</li>
                <li>Error prevention</li>
                <li>Recognition rather than recall</li>
                <li>Flexibility and efficiency of use</li>
                <li>Aesthetic and minimalist design</li>
                <li>Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors</li>
                <li>Help and documentation</li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Issues according to feedback</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Users are confused about the "money" in the proto 2.</li>
                <li>The task setting page of proto 1 are too crowded for them.</li>
                <li>They are confused about the break ticket in proto 1 at the first time.</li>
                <li>The plus buttons in proto 2 are confusing and the position of back button should be uniform.</li>
                <li>We don't have enough documentation to guide users.</li>
            </ul>

            <img src="image/focusco/flow.png" alt="">
            <img src="image/focusco/hi-fi.png" alt="">

            <h2>What's unique about Focus Co.?</h2>
            <p>Focus Co. is <span>light weighted</span>, provide just as much as what students need as a focus monitor.
                It can strictly monitor phone usage during study and also motivate people to stay focus and "earn
                money".
            </p>

                    <p>
                        In our design, users can select apps to receive or block notification during focus time.
                        Although this
                        function is idealized since it will need authorization from the operation system and other apps.
                        However,
                        if this function can be implmented, it would help people better focus on the job while also
                        notified if
                        important information is coming.

                    <p>
                        In our design, users are only allowed to leave the screen during break time. Early quit will
                        cause
                        half of their effort been taken away. This level of strictness will be useful to help people who
                        want
                        to stay focus but get cannot reject the lure of internet.

                        designed
                        this game system that convert the time they spend focuing to virtual salary under their account.
                        As they
                        earned enough money, they will be promoted to higher position with higher salaries. <span>Users

            </div>

            <h1>What we learned</h1>
            <p>The most important thing that I learned from this project is <span>Don't be idealized</span>. Before user
                testing, we
                all feel good about our prototype and we believe they are easy to understand. It turns out that user may
                not even get the
                core concept about some feature in the app. Also, users are more picky than we thought and there is
                indeed a gap between
                designers and users. <span>We really need user tests to make sure user understand our design.</span>
            </p>
            <p>Another thing is we cannot be too idealized about the function of an app. For Focus Co., we want it to be
                able to change
                notification settings of other apps and fix user on the current screen. Those two features are hardly
                possible to actually
                implement. Idea is just idea, <span>Designers need to learn to compromise and give in, either for
                    business value or
                    technique difficulties.</span>
